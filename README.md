# David's blog engine using Astro

Based on the astro-blog-tutorial and then customised to fit to how I wanted it to work.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│   │   └── index.astro
│   └── posts/
| 
└── package.json
```

## Development

- Uses `pnpm` for package management
